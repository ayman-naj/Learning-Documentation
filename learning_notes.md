## CPU Visual Simulator

URL: [CPU Visual Simulator] (https://cpuvisualsimulator.github.io/)

Summary of Content:
The CPU Visual Simulator shows a detailed view of how a CPU operates at the instruction level as it shows the step-by-step processes that can occur within a CPU during the execution of instructions, from fetching to decoding and executing.


Key takeaways:
  * the program counter is incremented by +2 because of the +2
  * to start off the content of the program counter is placed on the address bus
  * a fetch operation is then placed on the control bus
  * once the instruction is fetched, the code is decoded from that point on and then the program counter is incremeted
  * the content of the program counter is placed on the address bus

Reflection

Feedback: The CPU Visual Simulator helped me gain an understanding of how the instructions are passed in the CPU.

Reflection: With the CPU Visual Simulator you are able to really see the inner workings of a CPU. You can grasp an idea of how the CPU's operations work. It makes me want to look deeper on the processes of a CPU. 


## Visual Transistor-level Simulation

URL: [Visual Transistor-level Simulation] (http://www.visual6502.org/JSSim/expert.html)

Summary of Content:
The Visual Transister-level Simulation shows a complex display fo polygon models that represent each chip's physical components, showcasing how the elements form complete circuits. The simulation uses different colours to indicate the logic states and the types of materials in the circuits.

Key takeaways:
  * it displays polygon models of each chips physical components that form circuits altogether
  * the colours show whether the polygons are in a high or low logic state
  * each colour has represents different things:

          - green areas are diffusion which are connected to the ground
    
          - red areas are diffusion that are connected to the power
    
          -  yellow areas are diffusion that are neither connected to the ground or the power
    
          -  all the greyish areas represent metal
    
          - the purple parts are all polysilicon (purified form of silicon)
    * when there is the purple colour in between either green, red, or yellow, it kind of acts as a gate

Feedback: It was very cool taking a look at the Visual Transister-level Simulator because you get to see a deeper view into the physical construction and operation of computer chips.

Reflection: I was able to see how each tiny polygon was contributing to the functionality of the device.
